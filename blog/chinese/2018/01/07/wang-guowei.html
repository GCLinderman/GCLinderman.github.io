<p>治学三境界, “The three stages of
study,” but the word for study has a deeper meaning–it is not just studying
for a class, but it is doing scholarly research, studying something truly in
depth. Here is a calligraphy of these three stages.  The author is the
influential Wang Guowei （王国维)  and each “stage” is a verse from a different
Song dynasty poem.</p>

<p>1） 昨夜西风凋碧树,独上高楼，望尽天涯路：
Literal translation: Last night the West Wind  withered the green jade trees, I was alone on a a tall building, looking out on the far away roads.<br />
Meaning:  This comes from a poet in the Song Dynasty named 晏殊 who wrote it about the feeling of a traveller, looking out upon the world from a tower and missing his loved one(s).  The West Wind is a reference to the winds of autumn, which causes the leaves of the tree to fall, representing a feeling of sadness. The West Wind seems to have this melancholy meaning in Chinese literature.</p>

<p>Wang Guowei used this verse from the poem to describe what he refers to has the first stage of 治学, this deep scholarly endeavor. The first part refers to the feeling of perplexion, depression, and even intimidation at seeing the enormous task set before you. A scholar needs to first “stand on a tall building” to look at the big picture when planning the course of his/her study.  This includes stepping back and looking at the previous work that has been done in the field, i.e. the “far away roads” that others have walked.</p>

<p>2) 衣带渐宽不悔，为伊消得人憔悴
Literal Translation: Sash and belt slowly widen, but without any regrets, for her I languish, becoming wan and sallow.
Meaning:  This is from another Song poet named 刘永, written about the state of being fully engrossed by love.  He loves her so much, he does not even care for his own body.  When a teacher helped me understand this, she used another expression 茶不思饭不想, which means “have no thought for tea, no desire to eat.”  He is so engrossed in his love for her that nothing else matters, so that his clothes are soon too big for him because he has become emaciated from not eating.  But he says “ 不悔“ which means despite it all, he never regrets it.</p>

<p>Wang Guowei uses it to describe the passion with which someone devotes so much of his/her life and every bit of his/her focus on a topic of study.  He/she is willing to sacrifice anything and everything to attain his/her goal.  It especially emphasizes the suffering that one must be willing to endure to reach his/her goal–but never for a moment regretting any of it.  Here is a painting and calligraphy of this verse.</p>

<p>3)众里寻他千百度，蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处
Literal Translation: Searched for her thousands of times in a crowd, and then suddenly I turn my head, there she is in the place with the low light.
Meaning:  This is a verse from a third Song poet named 辛弃疾. It is incredibly deep, but my understanding is that he was looking for the one he loves in a crowd of thousands of beautiful people but cannot find her.  The setting is the 元宵节 which is the lantern festival.  Suddenly, he turns his head, and there she is, in the place where only a few lanterns are left (“the place with the low light”).  He found her, but only after looking so very hard–and even then, it was almost accidental that he just happened to turn his head and accidentally looked where she was.</p>

<p>Wang Guowei uses this to describe the feeling of looking for the answer with such tremendous effort, and then finally coming upon that “eureka” moment, when he understands–but it only can be obtained by looking a thousand times.  Then there is that moment of enlightenment, where you find something that no one had found before.</p>

<p>Baidu (百度) the Chinese equivalent of Google got its name from this verse (see the two characters), suggesting that using Baidu you can find what you are looking for, just like a scholar does in the Wang Guowei’s third stage of scholarly learning.</p>

<hr />

<p>Personally, I felt these three stages most poignantly last semester in my Real Analysis class.  I had skipped two of the prerequisite analysis classes and had not written a proof in four years, so it was just devastatingly difficult.  I can specifically remember each of those stages last semester, culminating in the final exam which I somehow managed to do well on.  Although a math class hardly counts as true scholarly research like Wang Guowei is referring to, it is where I experienced it most clearly.</p>

<p>More in line with Wang Guowei’s concept of 治学, I also feel that with regard to my PhD in general, I am very much at that first stage–learning the prerequisite mathematics and medicine that others have developed as a foundation (“standing on the tall building, looking out on the paths others have walked,”).  I can also relate to that “west wind;” the intimidation from the many problems that need to be solved, without a clear path going forward (i.e. a thesis topic), but by looking at the big picture, and continuing to learn the foundations, hoping to find the right way.</p>
